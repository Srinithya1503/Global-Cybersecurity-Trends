# Global Cybersecurity Threats: A Decade of Digital Risk (2015â€“2024)

##  Project Overview
This project explores global cybersecurity threats from 2015 to 2024 using a comprehensive dataset of reported incidents. The goal is to uncover patterns in threat types, affected regions, and temporal trends to better understand the evolving digital risk landscape.

##  Dataset
- **File**: `Global_Cybersecurity_Threats_2015-2024.csv`
- **Contents**: Includes threat type, country, industry, date, severity score, and incident description.

##  Objectives
- Identify the most common cybersecurity threats
- Analyze trends over time and across regions
- Visualize threat distribution by industry and geography
- Provide actionable insights for mitigation

## Definitions
**-What is Cybersecurity?**
 Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, devices, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, damage, or theft. It involves technologies, processes, and practices designed to safeguard digital information and ensure that systems remain secure, reliable, and available.

**-What are the common cyber attacks?**
 Viruses, worms, ransomware, spyware.
 Phishing attacks (fraudulent emails/websites).
 Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS) attacks.
 Data breaches and identity theft.

**- What is severity score and its relevance in analysis?**
  The severity score is a composite metric that quantifies the impact of each cybersecurity incident.
  It combines factors such as financial loss and number of affected users to provide a single value representing incident severity. This score helps in comparing incidents, identifying trends, and prioritizing response efforts based on overall impact.
